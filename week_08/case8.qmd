## Quarto
 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```
 
```{r}
data <- readr::read_table(ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.txt, skip = 45, col_names = c("year", "mean", "unc"), cols(
  year = col_double(),
  mean = col_double(),
  unc = col_double()
))
 
```
 
## Running Code
 
When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:
 
```{r}
# use
ggplot(data = mean, aes(x = year, y = mean)) +
geom_point() +
geom_line()
 
 
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
